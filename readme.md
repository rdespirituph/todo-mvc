## Answers

1. To ensure delivery of high-quality software:
   * Identify skillset of team members and plan for necessary upskilling
   * See what tools/resources are available
   * Recognize functionalities or utilities that can be developed first that will speed up other tasks
   * Assess value of units/modules against difficulty of test development for prioritization and roadmapping
   * Require peer reviews
   * Ask for daily updates
   * Sprint planning and review
2. Testing notes
   * When adding, check for duplicates and empty inputs
   * When removing, handle negative indexes
   
### Optional

1. Setup took time because packages are outdated and compatible typings are difficult to identify
2. End-to-end tests
